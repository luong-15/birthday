🚀 Quick Start
Download: Get the index.html file.

Open: Simply open index.html in your favorite modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Enjoy!

📖 How to Use
Launch the Application: Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Initial Interaction:

If you haven't set an avatar before, click the prominent "Open Your Gift" button. The app will then prompt you to upload your avatar.

If you have a saved avatar, clicking "Open Your Gift" will immediately reveal a birthday message, confetti, and play a celebratory sound.

Personalize Your Avatar (if prompted or to change existing):

If prompted, click the circular avatar frame in the modal. If an avatar is already displayed, gently hover your mouse over it and click the camera icon to open the editor.

Select an image file from your local device.

Within the editor, use the "Phóng to" (Zoom In) and "Thu nhỏ" (Zoom Out) buttons to adjust the image size. You can also drag the image directly on the canvas to perfectly position it within the circular crop area.

Click "Áp dụng" (Apply) to confirm your edits. Your new avatar will be saved locally, immediately displayed in the greeting, and trigger the confetti and sound effects.

Explore More Messages: If you'd like to see a different random birthday message, click the "Lời chúc khác ✨" button located in the bottom-right corner of the greeting card.
